 - [x] Vector (static size)
 - [x] Dynamic Square Matrix (n * n)

 - [ ] Buffer
 - [ ] DoubleBuffer
 - [ ] TripleBuffer
 - [ ] RingBuffer

 - [x] UniquePtr (`UniquePtr<T[], Deleter>` isn't implemented yet.)
 - [ ] SharedPtr

 - [ ] VariantArray (static size, dynamically allocated)
   - info: a dynamic storage for a finite set of types,
           where you can either set or get an object by its type.

 - [ ] String
 - [ ] DynamicVector

 - [ ] Queue
